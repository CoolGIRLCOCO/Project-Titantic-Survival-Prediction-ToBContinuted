    "As we can see above, there are several categorical variables which are stored as text values, including column 'Sex' (male, female), 'Embarked' (S, C, Q) and 'Title' (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Others). Regardless of what the value is used for, the challenge is determining how to use data in the analysis. As we know, many machine learning algorithms can deal with categorical variables without any manipulation but there are also some algorithms cannot do. How to turn these text attributes into numarics for further processing? Read http://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html if you want to know more methods about dealing with categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, we may think of converting categorical variables into ordinal numbers, however, categorical variables cannot tell us which levels should be more important than others, but ordinal numbers can. I think this method will make algorithms bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to unify our data and easy to do comparison based on the ML results, we will create dummy variables to convert each category value into a new column and assigns a 1 or 0 (True/False) value to the column. This has the benefit of not weighting a value improperly but does have the downside of adding more columns to the data set. To avoid multicolinearity (Dummy Variable Trap), I plan to remove the first dummy variables of all categorical variables, such as 'Sex_female', 'Title_Master' and 'Embarked_C'"

    "### 3.5 Introduction of Evaluation Matrics\n",
    "Before using multiple ML algorithms, let's talk about Evaluation Matrics in advance. How to define how effective an algorithm is? If it is hard to understand, maybe we can think about a simple question: How to tell if a restaurant is a good one. Are we judging the restaurants on the basis of their hotpot? Sushi? Ramen? Service? Or even In-store decoration?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what metrics do. As we know, Machine Learning algorithms work on constructive feedback principle. If we apply ML algorithms, get feedback from the metrics, make improvement(try other tuning parameters) and continue until you achieve a desirable criterion. We use evaluation matrics to explain the performance of an algorithm. Different performance metrics are used to evaluate different machine learning algorithms. In House Sale in King County project, as it is a regression problem, we use RMSE as metric. Titanic Survival project is a binary classification problem, so we will implement some other type of metrics, such as **Confusion Matrix**, **Accuracy**, **Specificity**, **Sensitivity**,  **Precision-Recall**, **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"confusionmatrix.png\" width = 550>\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification problem, after prediction, we can compare the predicted labels with the true labels to see whether our prediction is accurate or not. **Confusion Matrix** is one of the most intuitive and easiest metrics used for finding the correctness and accuracy of the model. The Confusion matrix itself is not a performance measure, but almost all of the performance metrics are based on Confusion Matrix and the numbers inside. \n",
    "\n",
    "**True Positives** are the cases when the actual class of the data point was True and the predicted is also True. **True Nagetives** are the cases when the actual class of data was False and the predicted is also Flase. **False Positives** are the cases when the actual class of the data point was False and the predicted is True. **False Negatives** are the cases when the actual class of data was True and the predicted is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, there are some other matrics based on confusion matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False Positive Rate** (Type I Error): b/(b+d), \n",
    "* **False Negative Rate** (Type II Error): c/(a+c),\n",
    "* **Specificity** (True Negative RATE): Number of items correctly identified as negative out of total negatives\n",
    "**Specificity** = d/(b+d) = 1 - Recall\n",
    "* **Sensitivity** (True Positive Rate/Recall): Number of items correctly identified as positive out of total true positives\n",
    "**Sensitivity** = a/(a+c)\n",
    "* **Accuracy**: Percentage of total items classified correctly\n",
    "**Accuracy** = (a+d)/(a+b+c+d)\n",
    "* **Precision**:  Number of items correctly identified as positive out of total items identified as positive\n",
    "**Precision** = a/(a+b)\n",
    "* **Recall**: Number of items correctly identified as positive out of total true positives\n",
    "**Recall** = a/(a+c)\n",
    "* **F1-score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall\n",
    "**F1** = 2*Precision*Recall/(Precision + Recall)\n",
    "* **ROC-AUC** ROC(receiver operating characteristic) curve a plot which illustrates the diagnostic ability of a classification algorithm at different classification thresholds. X axis is false positive(sensitivity) rate and y axis is true positive rate(1-specificity). ROC-AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve  from (0,0) to (1,1). AUC larger, the algorithm predict better.\n",

    "<img src = \"ROCAUC.png\" width = 350>\n",
    "\n",
    "So many different metrics listed above. **When to use what. It may be a problem we need to talk about.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### False Positive/False Negative:\n",
    "We know that there will be some error associated with every model that we used for predicting the true class of target variable. This will result in False Positive and False Nagetive. It depends on different needs of the problem to determine which one should be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Missing a cancer patient will be a huge mistake. If we want to correctly identify all cancerous patients from people, in order to catch all cancer cases, minimize FALSE NAGETIVE is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) However, if we want to classify whether an email is spam or not, it seems worse to classify a important email to spam than classify a spam email as important. In this situation, minimize FALSI POSITIVE is nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Accuracy\n",
    "Accuracy is a good measure when the target variable classes are nearly balanced. **But if target variable is not quite balanced, accuracy will not be a good metric.** For example, if we want to detect survival from 100 people and find only 5 are survived from Titanic disaster. Even though the model is terrible enough, all people are labeled as 'non-cancerous', the accuracy is still 95% high. In this situation, accuracy is not a good metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ROC-AUC\n",
    "Similar as accuracy, ROC-AUC is also a good measure when the target variable classes are nearly balanced. **But if target variable is not quite balanced, it will not be a good metric either.** Here is a kaggle example: https://www.kaggle.com/lct14558/imbalanced-data-why-you-should-not-use-roc-curve. To solve this problem, we can use Precision-Recall AUC instead of ROC-AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Precision and Recall\n",
    "Precision is a measure which tells us what proportion of people we predict as survived, acurally survived. Precision gives us information about performance with respect to false positive. if we want to minimize False Positive, make precision close to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall is a measure which returns what proportion of truly survived people was predicted by the algprithm as survived. Recall gives us information about a classifier's performance with respect to false negative. If we focus more on minimizing False Negative, we want recall close to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall plot is shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"PRAUC.png\" width = 250>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparing with ROC curve, precision-recall curve seems not effected much by inbalanced target variable.** Please see a comparison example in https://www.kaggle.com/general/7517#post41179.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"PRAUCexample.png\" width = 650>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### F1-score\n",
    "We use a balanced mean which is called harmonic mean to combine precision and recall together. Harmonic mean is a kind of an average when x and y are equal. But if x and y are different, marmonic mean returns a smaller one, giving the model an appropriate score rather than just an arithmetric mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"harmonic.png\" width = 180>\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually use both PR-AUC and F1-score when the target variable is inbalanced.\n",
